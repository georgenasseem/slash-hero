# Slash Hero

#### Slash Hero is a game made using unity. The goal of the game is to last on the playing field and dodge obstacles for as long as you can. Instructions to play Slash Hero, controls and contribution details are listed down below.

## Controls
Controls are pretty simple. Space to jump, double space to double jump, and A to attack with your sword. There is a 1 second timer between each attack, so time each attack carefully!

## Scoring of Slash Hero
Scoring in Slash Hero is measured in meters, you earn more meters the faster you go. Every 11 seconds your speed increases by 1. You start with 1 character, at 300 meters you will earn the red character, and at 700 meters you will earn the blue character.
